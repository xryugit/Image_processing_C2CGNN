# Fluorescence Microscopy Images processing 

## Brief summary 

Processed fluorescence microscopy data from mono- and co-cultures of MCF10A and T4 cells, utilizing kinase activity reporters (CFP/YFP) and Fra-1 fusion (RFP). Image processing included refining, noise reduction, cell and nuclei segmentation and tracking using Cellpose-Trackmate. Matched nuclei to cells and applied processing functions to compute nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio (N/C ratio) of fluorescence intensity for monitoring ERK activity in every single cell per time points. The images are from [Albeck Lab](https://albeck.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis.


While working at [Quon Lab](https://qlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis, I completed this project.
